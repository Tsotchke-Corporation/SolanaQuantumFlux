> ### 🔥 **UNLEASH THE POWER OF TRUE RANDOMNESS TODAY!** 🔥

## 🧩 The Missing Piece: True Randomness on Blockchain

> *"For too long, blockchain applications have been forced to rely on randomness that isn't actually random. TSOTCHKE QRNG changes EVERYTHING!"* 

TSOTCHKE QRNG delivers military-grade, quantum-inspired randomness directly on the Solana blockchain—revolutionizing what's possible in Web3 applications! By synthesizing quantum-inspired algorithms with Solana's high-performance architecture, we've created the first randomness solution that will transform your projects:

- ✨ **Truly Unpredictable**: Quantum-inspired entropy that passes all NIST randomness tests - goodbye predictability problems!
- 🔗 **Fully On-chain**: Complete transparency with 100% verifiable operation - users can TRUST your application!
- 💰 **Economically Efficient**: 60% less compute than alternatives with simple token-based pricing - save money instantly!
- ⚡ **Instantly Accessible**: Integrate in minutes, not weeks, with our comprehensive SDK - launch faster than ever!

For applications where fairness, security, and trust are mission-critical, TSOTCHKE QRNG isn't just a solution—it's your competitive advantage! 🏆

## 🏗️ Program Architecture

The diagram above illustrates how the TSOTCHKE QRNG system works. The Solana program returns Base64 encoded Hex values that are automatically decoded by our SDK into the appropriate data types (integers, doubles, or booleans) for your application. No hassle, no complexity—just pure randomness at your fingertips! ✨

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🧠 **High-Quality Entropy**: ~97.58% Shannon entropy with excellent statistical properties
- 🔬 **Quantum-Inspired Algorithm**: Combines multiple quantum-inspired techniques for true randomness
- 💸 **Token-Based Access**: Pay with $TSOTCHKE tokens (1 token per random number)
- 🔄 **Multiple Output Types**: Generate integers, floats, or booleans
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: 60% less compute units than conventional implementations
- 🔍 **Verifiable & Transparent**: All randomness generation is fully on-chain and auditable

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup - Ready in Minutes!

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Solana CLI tools (if working with direct program instructions)
- A Solana wallet with TSOTCHKE tokens

### 🚀 Setup for Local Development - Just 3 Quick Steps!

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsotchke-corporation/SolanaQuantumFlux.git
cd SolanaQuantumFlux
```

2. Install dependencies for the SDK:
```bash
cd sdk
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies for examples:
```bash
cd ../examples
npm install
```

## 💻 Using the SDK - Simplicity at Your Fingertips!

The SDK is currently available as source code in this repository. Jump right in with two easy options:

1. 📋 Copy the SDK source files directly into your project
2. 📦 Use the repository as a local dependency

### 🔍 Example Usage - Copy, Paste & Go!

```typescript
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { QrngClient } from '../path/to/sdk/src'; // Adjust path as needed

// Connect to Solana (use mainnet for production)
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com', 'confirmed');

// Create your wallet (for production, load from secure storage)
// This wallet must hold TSOTCHKE tokens
const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(/* your secret key */);

// Initialize the QRNG client
const qrngClient = new QrngClient(connection);

// Generate a random 64-bit integer
const randomNumber = await qrngClient.generateRandomU64(wallet);
console.log(`Your random number: ${randomNumber}`);
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Examples - See the Magic in Action!

1. Navigate to the examples directory:
```bash
cd examples
```

2. Build the examples:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Run a specific example:
