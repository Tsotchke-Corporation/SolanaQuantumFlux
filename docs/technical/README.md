## Understanding QRNG vs PRNG

### Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)

Traditional PRNGs work by:
- Starting with a seed value
- Applying deterministic algorithms to generate sequences
- Producing outputs that appear random but are actually predetermined
- Being vulnerable to prediction if the seed or algorithm is known

### Quantum-Inspired RNG (QRNG)

TSOTCHKE QRNG improves upon traditional PRNGs by:
- Combining multiple entropy sources
- Applying quantum-inspired algorithms for better statistical properties
- Implementing sophisticated mixing functions to enhance unpredictability
- Utilizing blockchain properties for additional entropy
- Providing verifiable, on-chain proof of the generation process
