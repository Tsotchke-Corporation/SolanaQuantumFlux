## Use Case Recommendations

### Gaming & Gambling

**Recommended: TSOTCHKE QRNG**

Gaming applications require high-quality randomness with immediate results and verifiability. TSOTCHKE QRNG provides the optimal balance of quality, speed, and transparency that users demand in provably fair gaming.

### NFT Generation

**Recommended: TSOTCHKE QRNG or Chainlink VRF**

Both solutions work well for NFT trait generation. TSOTCHKE QRNG is preferred for collections requiring immediate reveals, while Chainlink VRF may be suitable for delayed reveals where multi-block confirmation is acceptable.

### DeFi Applications

**Recommended: TSOTCHKE QRNG**

DeFi protocols requiring fair selection mechanisms benefit from TSOTCHKE QRNG's combination of high entropy and immediate results. This is particularly important for time-sensitive operations like liquidation selection.

### Low-stakes Applications

**Recommended: Solana PRNG or Hash-based**

For applications where absolute randomness quality is less critical and cost is a primary concern, simpler solutions may be adequate.
